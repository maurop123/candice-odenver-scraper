# candice-odenver-scraper
Web scraper for talks by Candice O'Denver

## Usage

This is a very basic script, uploaded soley for the purpose of aiding anyone who might also be looking for Candice O'Denver's free talks. It was written in 3 hours, and not with user experience in mind.

All you have to do to make this script work for you is...

1. Make sure you have Python 3 running on your computer
2. `pip install` the requisite libraries. Namely, `BeautifulSoup` and maybe `requests`
3. Change the folder prefix on line 46 of main.py to whatever folder on your computer you want the files to be saved to
4. Run `python main.py`

That's it! You should see the script downloading the files to your folder.

## Gotcha

The script for me stopped halfway through. That's almost 200 hours of listening, so not a bad start. If this gets fixed, I'll update the README accordingly.

And yes, contributions are welcome :)
